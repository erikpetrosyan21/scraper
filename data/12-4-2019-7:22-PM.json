      "\n\nArtificial Intelligence refers to the theory of computer systems or human-made robots programmed with performing tasks as humans, such as learning, generalization, and reasoning. With this ability, AI has become a significant part of human lives. Similarly, AI and the education & tutoring web solutions are inseparable from being observed by the astounding inventions enabling machines to mimic human roles.\n",
      "\n\nGambling has become popular among people these days.

      "\n\nMusic is seen as one of the most important aspects of life. Without it, life can be a bit dull and monotonous. While entertainment is mainly the purpose of music, recent studies and research attest that music impacts many things in one’s life, including focus and productivity.\n\nBenefits of Music\nFor many years now, music has been seen to offer numerous benefits to people who listen and utilize music. Aside from stirring emotions and memories, music can enhance mental performances and even cognitive functions. And this is probably one of the main reasons why parents send their kids to music lessons as young as possible. ",
      "\n\nFantasy sport is a type of game in which participants assemble a virtual team from a pool of real players from a sport such as football or basketball. They are then awarded points based on the performance of those players during the length of the game. The statistical performance of the players in the game is converted into ‘fantasy points’ that determine the outcome. The participant who accumulates the most fantasy points is deemed as the winner. \n\nThe user acts a virtual general manager who has complete control of their roster with abilities to draft, trade and drop players as per their choosing. Fantasy sports can be played in the context of a single game or can span the course of an entire season depending on the type of play and the league the user has enrolled in.\n\nThe fantasy sports industry, true to its name is quite a fantasy when we look at its history. The way in which it has evolved and grown is surely legendary. Here are a few facts that will put you in a state of awe.\n\n\nWilfred Winkenback teamed along with a few friends and created a rule book for fantasy football in 1962. This is the first attempt towards fantasy sports.\nThe first public Fantasy league was introduced by Andy Mousalimas, the founder of GOPPPL in 1969.\nThe rotisserie system of scoring for fantasy baseball was developed by a journalist Daniel Okrent in 1980.\nThe number of people playing fantasy football doubled from half a million in 1988 to 1 million in 1989. It was the first time that the user account had crossed the 1 million mark.\nIn 1999, when Yahoo was leading the world of the internet, it is set up the first free fantasy football system.\n",

      "\nIn the first part, we have deployed a simple dynamic CDN for broadcasting WebRTC streams to two continents and have proved on the example of a countdown timer that the latency in this type of CDN is actually low.\nIn the second part, we have incorporated dedicated servers into the CDN for performing the task of transcoding in order to provide good broadcast quality to our viewers based on the devices they use and the channel quality. In this manner, all published streams in our CDN are available to all the viewers.\nNow, assume that a company is starting to introduce its monetization strategy where a number of streams should be available for free and the rest on a subscription basis. Or, for example, webinars for in-house staff training are broadcasted simultaneously, but each subsidiary has a separate stream, and disclosing the sales techniques used in Southeast Asia to the managers from CIS countries is undesirable.",
      "\nDuring the summer of 2019, Huawei gave a series of presentations announcing the Ark Compiler technology. The company claims that this open-source project will help developers make the Android system and third-party software much more fluent and responsive. By tradition, every new promising open-source project goes through PVS-Studio for us to evaluate the quality of its code.\n\nIntroduction\nThe Ark Compiler was first announced by Huawei at the launch of the new smartphone models P30 and P30 Pro. It is claimed that the Ark Compiler will improve the fluency of the Android system by 24% and response speed by 44%. Third-party Android applications will also gain a 60% speed-up after recompilation with the Ark Compiler. The open-source version of the project is called OpenArkCompiler; its source code is available on Gitee, a Chinese fork of GitHub.",
      "React Native is the best open-source framework for Mobile App Developers that proved to be an advanced platform. Developed and promoted by Facebook, React Native became the most leading platform in the market. It can deliver apps on any platform with excellent performance and reliability. The ultimate aim of React Native is to cut down the reliance on web technologies like HTML and boost more dependence on native app development.\n\nUpgrades are all about exciting features from the old version. We update our mobile applications regularly to check the new features in different apps. Comparing to the 0.59 version, React Native 0.6 update has some great features in the list that will make the react native app development process quite smoother and easier.\n\nFor each reacts native developer, all the improvements play a crucial role, so we’ve drafted some exciting features that will make the process quite simple.",
      "Visual Studio IntelliCode uses machine learning to offer useful, contextually-rich code completion suggestions as you type, allowing you to learn APIs more quickly and code faster. Although IntelliCode’s base model was trained on over 3000 top open source C# GitHub repositories, it does not include all the custom types in your code base. To produce useful, high-fidelity, contextually-rich suggestions, the model needs to be tailored to unique types or domain-specific APIs that aren’t used in open source code. To make IntelliSense recommendations based on the wisdom of your team’s codebase, the model needs to train with your team’s code.\n\nEarlier this year, we extended our ML model training capabilities beyond our initial Github trained base model to enable you to personalize your IntelliCode completion suggestions by creating team models trained on your own code.\n\n",
      "\nIn the first part we have deployed a simple dynamic CDN for broadcasting WebRTC streams to two continents and have proved on the example of a countdown timer that the latency in this kind of CDN is actually low.\nHowever, besides low latency, it is important to provide good broadcast quality to users. After all, this is what they are paying for. In real life the channels between Edge servers and users can differ in bandwidth capacity and quality. For example, we are publishing a 720p stream at 2 Mbps, the user is playing it on an Android phone using 3G connection in an unstable signal reception area and the 360p maximum resolution that provides smooth picture at 400 Mbps is 360p.

      "\nA Zero-day (0-day) vulnerability is a computer-software vulnerability introduced during the development process and not yet discovered by the developers. Zero-day vulnerabilities can be exploited by hackers, thus affecting the company's reputation. Developers should seek to minimize the number of defects leading to such vulnerabilities. PVS-Studio, a static code analyzer for C, C++, C#, and Java code, is one of the tools capable of detecting security issues.",
      "Well, we've already discussed isolation and made a digression regarding the low-level data structure. And we've finally reached the most fascinating thing, that is, row versions (tuples).\n\nTuple header\nAs already mentioned, several versions of each row can be simultaneously available in the database. And we need to somehow distinguish one version from another one. To this end, each version is labeled with its effective «time» (xmin) and expiration «time» (xmax). Quotation marks denote that a special incrementing counter is used rather than the time itself. And this counter is the transaction identifier.\n\n(As usual, in reality this is more complicated: the transaction ID cannot always increment due to a limited bit depth of the counter. But we will explore more details of this when our discussion reaches freezing.)",
      "Do you know there were 5 million apps in 2019? Out of these millions of apps, only a few are able to perform. There are many reasons for this but a major factor is the interactivity of an app.\n\nNo matter which product you are trying to sell, customers choose the one which allows them to get involved. Interactive apps are in demand for a long time. Are you wondering how can you make an interactive app?\n\nThe first thing which comes to our mind when we talk about interactive apps is the concept of single page application. This is because SPAs are known for their capacity to interact with the user by reloading some page elements dynamically depending upon the interaction by the user.",
      "\nWe've developed a unified four-layer model for app promotion and added our recommendations.Before we wrote this article we had our apps downloaded over two million times, ran about 50 large promotional campaigns, and made it onto the App Store top-lists in over 24 countries to finally combine all of it into a single workflow.\nYou won’t find almost any obvious stuff about keywords, nice-looking icons, screenshots, or ad campaigns in this article. We’ve tried to develop a unified model for a product-focused company based on our experience by answering the questions “What? When? Why?” and even “And what then?”\nIf you’re developing your own app, want to start developing one, or just have a friend who’s a developer or marketing professional at a product-focused company, you’ll find lots of useful information in this article.",
      "\n\nBeing a developer, I love to code especially in JavaScript. As per my experience, using reduce function is one of the toughest tasks in JS. Let me first elaborate on the Reduce concept!\n\nIn Wikipedia, it has many names viz.\n\nReduce\nFold\nAccumulate\nAggregate\nCompress\n\nIt is a function that folds a list into any data type. It's all about breaking a structure down into a single value. It's like folding a box! With reduce, you can turn an array [1,2,3,4,5] into the number 15 by adding them all up.",
      "\n\nImage credit: Unsplash\n\nWorking on a startup is always hard. Founders have to master multitasking skills and control everything. Very often, in such a situation, they can't correctly assess the technological development of their company. A couple of wrong tech-related decisions can lead to a massive fail. \n\nHow to avoid this? Get some advice from an experienced engineer! I had an opportunity to talk to Serhii Korniushov, a programmer, and IT manager with more than 10 years of experience. \nBelow, we will discuss his recommendations on building products that users need, and not wasting time and money.",
      " \n\nIt is probably basketball that brought the context of the word 'shoot' away from gun games. Basketball has been steadily growing in popularity ever since the invention of the game by James Naismith. The inception of the NBA has only served as a catalyst in promoting the growth and reception of the game.\n\nThese days, most of the sports are complemented by a fantasy sporting application. In a game that has a fan following and rage like basketball, fantasy sports applications are bound to engage users and bring in profits.\n\nAt this juncture, we are called to look at two aspects. One is about the growth of basketball on a worldwide scale and the other is about the fantasy applications opening avenues for a new and lucrative business opportunity. ",
      "An Ionic framework is an HTML5 mobile app development framework that helps us to develop hybrid mobile apps. The hybrid apps are a significantly small website that runs in the browser shell in an app that has access to the native platform layer. These apps have many advantages over pure native applications, which are defined in terms of platform support, speed of development and access to the third-party code.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges that companies normally face while creating mobile apps is the project's cost. As per the reports of specialists, they recommend going for hybrid technologies to save some bucks.\n\nAfter NodeJS and angular, Ionic has attained a huge reputation among JavaScript-based programming languages or frameworks. By using the SAAS, the Ionic framework provides users with many user interface features which help in building interactive elements. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and then converts them into native code to make the application available for mobile devices.\n\nThis framework is a very successful hybrid framework because its user interface copies the native apps UI. So developers need not worry about the implementation of native appearing UI as Ionic does this for them automatically."
